# Student Auto-Grading System
This is a C++ console program to grade students based on the In-semester and End-semester exams' marks obtained by them in their respective subjects.
## Brief Description
In this program, a Student Auto-Grading System is designed using the concepts of Object-Oriented Programming and coded in the C++ programming language. This system is designed to calculate the final result, in terms of “Pass” and “Fail”, of a student in a subject by analysing his/her marks in the In-semester and End-semester examinations in that subject. Moreover, the program is able to take into account any number of students and their marks in their respective subjects. In addition to that, the program is capable to import a list of courses available for the students in the form of a CSV file structured in a specific way. The program is also capable of exporting the results of the students to a CSV file for further perusal. The program contains classes such as Course, Student etc along with their member variables and functions in order to facilitate its proper functioning. Additionally, the concepts of Object-Oriented Programming such as Inheritance and Polymorphism are also put into use.
### Guidelines for Analysing the results
* A student is declared to pass a Theory course if he/she secures at least 28 marks in the End-semester  examination and a total of 40 marks while taking into account both In-semester and End-semester examinations.
* A student is declared to pass a Laboratory course if he/she secures at least 35 marks in the End-Semester examination and a total of 50 marks while taking into account both In-semester and End-semester examinations.
